## Routes between cities
#### CODE CHALLENGE
<p>You’re asked to write a program in Java which determines if two cities are connected.
Two cities are considered connected if there’s a series of roads that can be traveled from one city to another.</p>
<p>List of roads is available in a file.
File contains a list of city pairs (one pair per line, comma separated), which indicates that there’s a road between those cities.</p>
<p>It will be deployed as a spring-boot app and expose one endpoint:
http://localhost:8080/connected?origin=city1&destination=city2
</p>
<p>Your program should respond with ‘yes’ if city1 is connected to city2, ’no’ if city1 is not connected to city2.
Any unexpected input should result in a ’no’ response.
</p>

    Example:
    city.txt content is:
    Boston, New York
    Philadelphia, Newark
    Newark, Boston
    Trenton, Albany

    Links
    http://localhost:8080/connected?origin=Boston&destination=Newark
    Should return yes
    http://localhost:8080/connected?origin=Boston&destination=Philadelphia
    Should return yes
    http://localhost:8080/connected?origin=Philadelphia&destination=Albany
    Should return no
    
##IMPORTANT
* This exercise is a take-home assignment. It needs to be completed within 1-3 days.
* Use Github as a repository for your solution
* The completed assignment should be emailed back to myself – in the form of the GitHub URL - along with accompanying tests used for verification.

#SOLUTION IS DESCRIBED BELOW
,p>
Text file city.txt contains data. This data is intentionally made "dirty" - some lines are skipped, some other lines contain just one term instead of two. Dirty data is ignored by the service. The one-letter names are added to the file to test "long" chains like: a-->b-->c--> d therefore a-->d</p>

    ===========beginning of data file city.txt ===========
        Boston  ,   New York  
          Philadelphia  ,    Newark    
            
           
        
          Newark,     Boston   
         Trenton   ,        Albany  
          
          
         
        dfsdfsdf 
       
       a,b
          b,c
             c,d
         d,a
      d,f
     f,a
      
       
      cvxcv
        
    ===========end of data file city.txt ===========
##Algorithm
* Program reads the city.txt file line by line and populates a Map<String, Set<Strng>> which has a key as one city name and as value it has a Set of all cities connected to the "key-city" by a route.
* Here is data example in the Map:

   | Key          |      Set               |
   | :------------|:---------------------- |
   | Boston       |     New York, Newark   |
   | New York     |     Boston             |

- I am using Set (not a List) to avoid duplicates. Java Set silently ignores duplicates - very convenient in this case.
- Then I look up the first key-city in the key set of the Map and recursively lookup all the cities in the set.
- While doing this I keep a Set of cities which have been searched for already to avoid cycles and endless loops.
- Finally, I either find a match and report back a result "yes" or do not have match or get an error - in this case the result is "no" as specified in the requirements.
- a city name is case-sensitive: boston and Boston are two **different** cities

# How to build and run the service
* Prerequisites:
  * Java 8
  * Maven
  * Git
* Create a new directory
       `mkdir temp`
*  Navigate to the new directory
       `cd temp`
  * clone GitHub repository by running the following git command:
        `git clone https://github.com/AlexGordonGBS/com.alex.gordon.cityroutes.git`
  * navigate inside the project directory:
        `cd com.alex.gordon.cityroutes/`
  * run project build:
       `mvn clean install`
  * navigate to the target directory:
        `cd target/`
  * run SpringBoot program
       `java -jar com.alex.gordon.cityroutes-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
  * open your browser and type the following URL inot the address field:
       `https://http://localhost:8080/connected?origin=New%20York&destination=Albany`
  * enjoy playing with the service
